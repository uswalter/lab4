## Part 2.

### - For the first trial of trying the first style, log in to ssh and use Vim for editing, if running remotely, it's better and faster to run bash test.sh because you don't have to open the folder on your local machine to Production Editing, In the second trial, I could save some time by copy and pasting the command I used before.

### - While I'm looking at the first way to save more time, for a first attempt at trying the second way, by using vim directly in the remote server.


### first style will be a better choice for projects that need to modify multiple java files at the same time, switching from one java file to another for comparison or connection.
